The **VisHub** is an interdisciplinary research lab seeking creative ways to interactive, exploratory and explanatory data visualizations across domains and environments (e.g., screen, physical, immersion). Our goal is to make data visualiztion and data analytics understandable by everyone. We are based at the [Institute for Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org/) and the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). Our research includes, but is not limited to:

-   data-driven storytelling,
-   visualization education
-   immersive Analytics,
-   network and spatio-temporal visualization,
-   physical visualization,
-   data visualization and NLP

We are heavily involved in co-organizing [Edinburgh's Data Vis Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-vBHbCmgh). [Get in touch with us](mailto:bbach@ed.ac.uk) if you want to become involved.

## Data Visualization Cheat Sheets

![](figures/cheatsheets.png)
Data Visualization Cheat Sheets are aimed at supporting learning and teaching of data visualization techinques and investigate ways to better teach data visualization in general. [visualizationcheatsheets.github.io](http://visualizationcheatsheets.github.io)

## Data Comics

![](figures/datacomics.png)
Data Comics combine visual language and narrative patterns from traditional comics to tell expressive stories with data and visaulization. We explore this exciting medium and develop workshops and guiding material. [datacomics.net](http://datacomics.net)

## Immersive Analytics

![](figures/immersiveanalytics.png)
The **[Edinburgh VisHub](http://edinburghvishub.github.io)** is an university-wide lab for data visualization equipment to foster research, collaboration, learning, and outreach. **[DXR](https://sites.google.com/view/dxr-vis)** and **[IATK](https://github.com/MaximeCordeil/IATK)** are two toolkits for creating immersive data visualizations in augmented and virtual reality. Check how to participate in our [upcoming workshop at CHI 2020](http://immersiveanalytics.io).
