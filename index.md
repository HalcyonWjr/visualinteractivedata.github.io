__Visual<b style="color:red;">+</b>Interactive Data__ group is researching interactive, exploratory and explanatory visualizations across environments such as screen, tangible, and immersion to support interdisciplinary research to understand and communicate complex data. _Visual+Interactive Data_ is based at the [Institute for Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org/) and the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). Our research includes, but is not limited to areas in 

* network and spatio-temporal visualization, 
* data-driven storytelling, 
* visualization in augmented and virtual reality (Immersive Analytics), 
* non-digital and physical visualization, and 
* teaching and learning visualization. 

Visual<b style="color:red;">+</b>Interactive Data is heavily involved in co-organizing [Edinburgh's Data Vis Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-vBHbCmgh). [Get in touch with us](mailto:bbach@ed.ac.uk) if you want to become involved.
