__Visual<b style="color:red;">+</b>Interactive Data__ is a research group that investigates data visualizations and intreractive means to make data more immediate, tangible, and understandable. _Visual+Interactive Data_ is based at the [Institute for Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org/) and the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk).  Our research includes, but is not limites to the following areas:

* Network Visualization
* Visualization of spatio-temporal data
* Data-driven storytelling
* Visualization in Augmented and Virtual Reality (Immersive Analytics)
* Non-digital visualization
* Teaching and learning visualization, Visual Analytics

Visual+Interactive Data is heavily involved in co-organizing Edinburgh's [Data Vis Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-vBHbCmgh). Get in touch with is if you want to become involved.

## Joining Us

* **PhD:** Please contact me directly (e.g., at VIS in Vancouver at the moment). (Competitive) Funding is available.
* **MSc dissertation:** Check how to plan your project and contact me directly. Ideally, we combine your DI project and MSc * to run roughly on the same topic.
* **Research internships** are possible all year around. The University asks for a fee for more than 12. Funding might be available for selected projects
