# Chart Clinic

The VisHub group offers a monthly **Chart Clinic** to researchers and students at the University of Edinburgh. On the last Friday of every month, one or more [members of our group](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/people.html) will be available on Teams from 3-4pm (UK time) to give advice on your charts and visualisations (for your websites, papers, posters, presentations, etc.).

No sign-up required, just drop in, bring your visualisation and questions. We'll try our best to help you (re)design your visualisation and can help to brainstorm solutions. We will not be able to design or implement a visualisation for you. We are also be around for general questions about visualisation design, tools, methods, theory, etc. Note that the field is growing very quickly—we will try our best to help you navigate the jungle. 

Since this is a pilot, the ChartClinic is currently only open only to University staff and graduat(e/ing) students working on their theses. To join a session, join our Chart Clinic Team on MS Teams. The link to join is not public, but is sent by email a few days before each session.
