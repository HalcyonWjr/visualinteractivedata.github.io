# How To (survive a) Design Informatics MSc Dissertation (in data visualization)

## What is the purpose of an MSc thesis?

The idea of an MSc thesis is to show that you are capable of individual intellectual work. 
_- Can you think and deal with chaos? 
- Can you define a problem? 
- Can you plan your methods? 
- Can you present results? 
- Can you reflect and discuss your work? 
- Do you know the context of your well enough?_

## Components of a Dissertation

A Design Informatics MSc thesis consists of largely 4 components: 
- a problem: a problem you describe that requires solution. Ideally, this a hard problem but it must be described and credible. 
- a solution: an idea for a tool, a design, a system, survey, etc. that aims to address the problem.
- a concept/idea: a concept that is the basis for your solution (e.g., a novel approach or some creative thinking). 
- an evaluation: some data / evidence how this solution is helping with your problem.

## Project planning

An MSc dissertation is usually between 3-4 months. This is very short. Below is a possible outline how you should place your milestones. 
- Month 1 (Exploraton & Scoping) : 
  - [ ] literature review: search for papers, textbooks, websites. Read. Read. Read. Ask your supervisor for seed papers to start from
  - [ ] formulate your problem. Discuss with your supervisor
  - [ ] understand your problem (i.e., gather evidence so you are confident about the problem. Your supervisor will help)
  - [ ] do some initial designs, exploration, ideation to figure out which solutions to pursue. Discuss with your supervisor
- Month 2 (Design & Implememtation):
  - [ ] Set on 1-2 possible solutions to pursue and implement, i.e., realize, craft, deploy, etc.
  - [ ] Iterate over these solutions. 
  - [ ] discuss with your peers, 
  - [ ] explore alternative solutions and justify your decisions
  - [ ] collect ideas for a possible evaluation 
  - [ ] ask for [ethics approval](ethics) by the School of Informatics. Talk to your supervisor for help. 
- Month 3 (Evaluation & Iteration):
  - [ ] plan and conduct evaluation. Ask your supervisor for help and resources (e.g., rooms, materials)
  - [ ] collect data about evaluation 
  - [ ] analyze data
  - [ ] possibly improve prototype during evaluation.
- Month 4 (Discussion & Writing-up): 
  - [ ] polish prototype based on evaluation results. Prioritize those issues most pressing for your contribution
  - [ ] discuss your research: reflect on the results, discuss limitations, 
  - [ ] write up your thesis.

See general information on how to plan a project and contribution [here](project-planning).

## Writing up

All the grader sees is your thesis writing. Hence: 
- explain any specific terminology you use. More explanation does not hurt. 
- create meaningful figure captions that explain what these figures show. 
- explain the figure content in the text. 
- demonstrate your design and prototype through figures and examples. Text is often not enough. 
- add a URL (video, website) to demonstrate your design. This helps enormously
- explain **your** research, not other people's work: around 70% of the writing should focus on your work and your thinking, not describing well known concepts and background. Most of the related and conceptual work should go into into introduction, related work, and discussion.

You need to describe each of these in your thesis. More information on technical writing [here](technical-writing.md).

## What is a 'good dissertation'? 

- A **good thesis (A3)**, contains all four concepts mentioned above and is easy to follow, clear to understand and clearly demonstrate intellectual engagement and knowledge.
- A **very good thesis (A2)** shows creativity beyond a standard approach to solve and evaluate the problem. It has a good question that can have some significance beyond this thesis and the specific problem you look at. It also shows that you can think creatively, explore solutions, and come up with a solid solution yourself. There is some chance this could be included into a publication / furthered into a publication.
- An **outstanding thesis (A1)** provides some novel results, creative thinking, and rigorous and critical engagement with the topic. The thesis presents a novel concept worth publishing and of relevance to other researchers far beyond the School and your supervisor.
