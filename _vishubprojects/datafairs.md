title: Data Fairs
description: The data fair is an event that brings together our Master students in Design Informatics from the University of Edinburgh (School of Informatics and College of Art) and external partners (you!). We invite external partners to share their real-world data with our students, collaborate on data analysis and visualization, and ideally end up with a project that you can share publicly.
