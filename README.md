# Website of the Visual+Interactive Data group at the University of Edinburgh

[visualinteractivedata.github.io](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/)


## How to work on this site locally
- Make sure you have [Ruby and Jekyll installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- Clone this repo to your computer
- Open a command line in that folder, run "bundle update" then "bundle exec jekyll serve"
- The website should now be available at localhost:4000

*This works on my (Sarah's) Windows setup - cannot vouch for anything else, but this is the general principle of running Jekyll sites locally*
