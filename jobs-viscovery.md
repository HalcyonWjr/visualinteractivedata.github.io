The Viscovery project is looking for a postdoc (up to 2 years) and a research engineer/postdoc at the University of Edinburgh. 

## Project

This project aims to create a *Viscovery*, a platform to guide novice analysts in visual networks analysis data. The project will explore methods from recommender systems and interactive data-driven storytelling (e.g. [Data comics](datacomics.net)) to mimic a human demonstrators walking a domain scientist through findings in their data. Our focus is on researchers in the humanities and network science with an effective way to learn novel interactive visualisation techniques for understanding complex geo-spatial and temporal networks. We will strongly build on concepts from data comics and The Vistorian ([Vistorian](datacomics.net))

Our research will provide a better understanding of the feasibility and success of automatically presenting and walking novice analysts through their data. Results of our research include novel visualisation and interaction techniques, an open visualisation platform, design guidelines, evaluation results, open-source
code, case studies, design patterns, etc. Publications are aimed to be presented at top-tier international
conferences (CHI, VIS, EuroVis) and journals (TVCG).

The project is lead by [Benjamin Bach](http://benjbach.me). We will collaborate with researchers in network analysis, archeology, and history in the UK and across Europe.

## Environment

The [VisHub](visualinteractivedata.github.io) is an interdisciplinary visualization group comprising faculty, postdocs, PhD students, and master students in Design Informatics (winter to summer). The succesful candidates are encouraged to engage in both PhD and MSc supervision as well as teaching (extra pay). The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh is ranked 12th in the latest global QS rankings and offers many possiblities for interdiscipliny collaborations across the school and country. Edinburgh is a beautiful, international, and academic place amidst the Scottish nature and close to the wild Islands and Highlands. 

The PI will help the postdoc and research engineer with career planning, networking, and teaching relevant research skills relevant to the project and beyond (methodolgy, proposal writing, etc.).

## Organization

The following includes both roles, postdoc(s) and research engineer

* **Start:** as soon as possible
* **Duration:** up to 2 years
* * **Visa:** Required for all non-UK applicants and organized by the Unversity.
* **Eligibility postdoc:** PhD in visualization or related areas 
* **Eligibility research engineer:** strong web and visualization development skills, PhD and interest in research preferred. 
* **Fields of expertise/interest:** exploratory visualization, data-driven storytelling, network analysis, human-computer interaction, web-development

Due to Covid-19, remote work is possible but relocation is preferred whenever lab life returns.
