# Postdocs / research engineer

The Viscovery project is looking for a postdoc (up to 2 years) and a research engineer (no phd) or postdoc (with phd) at the University of Edinburgh.

## Project

**This project aims to develop visualizations, interfaces, and systems to guide analysts in their exploration of geo-temporal network data within the humanities** (history, social science, archaeology, etc.). To that end, we will get inspiration from **interactive data-driven storytelling (e.g. [Data comics](datacomics.net))** and recommender systems to mimic a human demonstrators walking the domain scientist through findings. 

Our research aims to provide new ways to support interactive exploration for network data as well as training novice-analysts in data and visualization literacy. A research engineer role will support the development of the [Vistorian](http://vistorian.net) platform for network analysis. Publications are aimed to be presented at top-tier international conferences (CHI, VIS, EuroVis).

The project is lead by [Benjamin Bach](http://benjbach.me). We will collaborate with researchers in network analysis, archeology, and history in the UK, across Europe, and beyond.

## Environment

Both positions are hosted by the [VisHub](visualinteractivedata.github.io) at the University of Edinburgh. The Vishub is an interdisciplinary visualization group including faculty, postdocs, PhD students, and master students in Design Informatics (winter to summer) and collaborations in public health, NLP, history, social sciences, international law, and industry. The succesful candidates can engage in both PhD and MSc/MA supervision as well as teaching (extra pay). 

The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh is ranked 12th in the latest global QS rankings and offers many possiblities for interdiscipliny collaborations. Edinburgh is a beautiful, international, and academic place amidst the Scottish nature and close to islands and Highlands. 

The PI will help the postdoc and research engineer with career planning, networking, and teaching relevant research skills relevant to the project and beyond (methodolgy, proposal writing, etc.).

## Organization

The following includes both roles, postdoc(s) and research engineer

* **Start:** as soon as possible
* **Duration:** up to 2 years
* * **Visa:** Required for all non-UK applicants and organized by the Unversity.
* **Eligibility postdoc:** PhD in visualization or related areas 
* **Eligibility research engineer:** strong web and visualization development skills, PhD and interest in research preferred. 
* **Fields of expertise/interest:** exploratory visualization, data-driven storytelling, network analysis, human-computer interaction, web-development

Due to Covid-19, remote work is possible but relocation is preferred whenever lab life returns.
